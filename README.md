# ðŸŒ‡ Wakenbake
## By Genericmilk

Wakenbake is a super small jQuery script that allows a visual effect on page load for a "rising card" look.

### To install

Simply include this script in your footer (After jQuery has loaded) (Or better still, using Cooker at https://github.com/genericmilk/cooker ðŸ˜‰ add it to the `/resources/js/libraries` folder)

Then simply include `data-fade="true"` on as many elements as you like!

Then on page load, elements will rise and fade in with a small delay between each

### Roadmap

I'm looking to make this script more customisable and importantly not rely on jQuery in the future to support other workflows! Enjoy!
